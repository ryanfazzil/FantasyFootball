# Fantasy Football Tracker

## **Proposal**

My personal project for the term will be a fantasy football application
, my plan is to make an application where someone can input the teams in their fantasy football league including their own.
As well as any other leagues they are in. The application will also have statistics for every player on teams in the league, which would allow
managers to properly value their team.

My hope is that people who enjoy fantasy football to use this application
and it potentially help them have a better understanding of their current team state.
This project is of interest to me because I have loved playing fantasy football for years and have always thought
about trying to make an application of this sort so that I could potentially use it for my fantasy leagues.
